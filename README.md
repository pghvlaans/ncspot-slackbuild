# ncspot-slackbuild

Now that the latest versions of `ncspot` can be built on Slackware 15.0 (with `rust16` as a 15.0-only dependency), it is no longer necessary to provide a separate script for Slackware -current. This repo has been archived.

Visit SlackBuilds Online for the latest [ncspot](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/audio/ncspot/?search=ncspot) and [rust16](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/development/rust16/?search=rust16) scripts.
